# Metrics & Results — Robinson R44 Raven II e-Learning

This document summarizes **portfolio-style outcomes** and example metrics used to evaluate an aviation e-learning/CBT product. Where exact figures are confidential, results are described qualitatively and/or with placeholders you can later replace.

## Success Measures (What “Good” Looked Like)

### Learner Outcomes
- **Completion rate:** % of learners completing the course within a defined time window
- **Assessment performance:** pass rate, average score, reattempt rate
- **Time to complete:** median time vs expected duration (helps validate pacing)
- **Knowledge check effectiveness:** common wrong answers and learning gaps

### Training Organization Outcomes
- **Instructor workload reduction:** fewer repeated briefings / more time for high-value training
- **Consistency of delivery:** standardized content across cohorts and locations
- **Readiness signals:** instructors report improved baseline knowledge before practical sessions

### Product/Business Outcomes
- **Adoption signals:** number of organizations using the course, repeat use for recurrent training
- **User satisfaction:** survey feedback (e.g., clarity, usability, relevance)
- **Support load:** types of issues reported (content clarity vs technical usability)

## Public Product Facts (From the course page)
- Approximate learning time: **~9 hours**
- Structure: **10 modules**
- Assessment depth: **100+ questions**
- Embedded validation: **20+ knowledge checks**

(These details are reflected publicly on the product page and can be referenced in your README.)

## Results & Impact (Portfolio Summary)
- Delivered a **modular CBT course** supporting initial and recurrent R44 Raven II training
- Improved learner accessibility through **self-paced, multi-device learning**
- Reduced repetitive instructor time spent on baseline theory briefings (based on stakeholder feedback)
- Established a **repeatable development approach** for future aircraft-type e-learning products

## What We Learned From the Data (Example Insights)
*(Use these as patterns; replace with your actual learnings where possible.)*

- **Completion behavior:** learners often pause mid-course and return later → resume capability is critical
- **Assessment design:** too many similar questions reduces engagement → vary question types and difficulty
- **Mobile usage:** a meaningful portion of learners access content on mobile → touch-first interactions matter
- **Hard topics:** certain systems/procedures consistently generate wrong answers → add visuals and reinforcement

---

## Opportunities / Next Iteration Metrics
If iterating the product, I would track:
- **Drop-off points** by module/lesson (where learners stop)
- **Question-level analytics** (most-missed questions)
- **Cohort comparisons** (initial vs recurrent learners)
- **Training organization reporting needs** (exports, audit readiness, filtering)
