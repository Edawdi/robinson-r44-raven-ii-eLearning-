# Robinson R44 Raven II e-Learning  
_Product ownership case study_
## Overview

This repository presents a **product ownership case study** for the Robinson R44 Raven II e-learning course, a computer-based training (CBT) product designed for helicopter pilots undergoing initial and recurrent training.

The product delivers a structured, interactive learning experience covering aircraft systems, procedures, and operational knowledge, while meeting regulatory requirements for aviation training organizations.
## Problem Context

Traditional helicopter ground training relies heavily on instructor-led briefings and static materials, which can be time-consuming, inconsistent, and difficult to scale across training organizations.

The Robinson R44 Raven II e-learning product was created to:
- Standardize theoretical training content
- Reduce instructor workload
- Improve learner accessibility through multi-device support
- Enable scalable, compliant training delivery
## My Role

I acted as the **Product Owner** for this product and was responsible for:

- Defining product vision and scope
- Managing the product backlog and prioritization
- Translating regulatory and user needs into actionable requirements
- Collaborating with subject-matter experts, designers, and engineers
- Overseeing delivery from concept through release
- Evaluating feedback and identifying improvement opportunities
## Product Objectives

The primary objectives of the Robinson R44 Raven II e-learning product were to:

- Provide a comprehensive and structured theoretical training solution for the R44 Raven II helicopter
- Support both initial and recurrent pilot training
- Ensure compliance with applicable aviation training regulations (EASA / FAA)
- Enable training organizations to reduce dependency on instructor-led ground sessions
- Deliver a consistent learning experience across multiple devices and locations
## Product Scope & Key Features

The product was delivered as a modular computer-based training (CBT) course with the following scope:

- Aircraft overview and limitations
- Detailed systems coverage (engine, fuel, electrical, rotor systems)
- Normal and emergency procedures
- Interactive walk-around training
- Knowledge checks and assessments embedded throughout the course
- Cross-platform accessibility (desktop and mobile devices)

The modular structure allowed training organizations to adapt the course to different training programs and learner needs.
## Outcomes & Impact

The Robinson R44 Raven II e-learning product was successfully delivered and adopted by aviation training organizations as part of their pilot training programs.

Key outcomes included:
- A structured course consisting of multiple learning modules and assessments
- Improved learner accessibility through self-paced, device-agnostic training
- Reduced instructor time required for repetitive theoretical briefings
- Positive feedback from training organizations regarding clarity and usability

The product established a reusable framework for developing future helicopter-type e-learning courses.
## Key Learnings

This project reinforced the importance of:

- Close collaboration with subject-matter experts when translating complex technical content into learner-friendly material
- Balancing regulatory requirements with user experience
- Structuring content modularly to support scalability across aircraft types
- Iterative refinement based on stakeholder and user feedback
