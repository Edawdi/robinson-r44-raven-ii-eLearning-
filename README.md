# Robinson R44 Raven II e-Learning — Product Case Study

## 👋 Overview
This case study shows how I led product ownership for the **Robinson R44 Raven II e-learning course** at Evionica, designed for helicopter pilots (initial & recurrent training). The product delivers an interactive CBT (computer-based training) experience covering aircraft systems, procedures, and operational knowledge, with a focus on regulatory-aligned training delivery for aviation organizations.

> Note: This repository shares *non-confidential* product ownership artifacts and a portfolio-style narrative. Proprietary/internal details are intentionally generalized.

## 🧩 Problem Context
Traditional helicopter ground training often relies on instructor-led briefings and static materials. This can be:
- Time-consuming to deliver repeatedly
- Difficult to standardize across instructors and locations
- Hard to scale across multiple training organizations
- Less accessible for learners who need flexible, self-paced study

This product was created to standardize and scale theoretical training while improving learner accessibility.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
The primary objectives of the Robinson R44 Raven II e-learning product were to:
- Provide a structured theoretical training solution for the **R44 Raven II**
- Support both **initial** and **recurrent** training use cases
- Offer **self-paced, multi-device** access (“anytime, anywhere” learning)
- Reduce dependency on repetitive instructor-led ground sessions
- Align with common aviation training organization requirements and regulatory expectations (EASA / FAA operating environments)

## 🧑‍💻 My Role (Product Owner)
As the **Product Owner**, I was responsible for:
- Defining product vision, scope, and release goals
- Owning the backlog and prioritization (trade-offs, sequencing, MVP scope)
- Translating stakeholder, learner, and regulatory needs into actionable requirements
- Collaborating with SMEs (subject-matter experts), instructional designers, UX/design, and engineering
- Facilitating sprint planning and delivery tracking
- Monitoring feedback post-release and driving iterative improvements
- Communicating progress and decisions to internal leadership and external stakeholders

---

## 📦 Product Scope & Key Features
The product was delivered as a modular CBT course, designed to be easy to adopt and scale.

**Core scope included:**
- Aircraft overview and operational context
- Systems coverage (e.g., engine, fuel, electrical, rotor-related concepts)
- Normal and emergency procedures (theory + decision support)
- Interactive walk-around / inspection training
- Knowledge checks and assessments throughout the course
- Cross-platform accessibility (desktop + mobile)

**Design principle:** a modular structure that allows training organizations to fit the course into different training programs and learner needs.

## 🧭 Delivery Approach
A few product practices that shaped delivery:
- **Incremental scope**: phased content/module rollout rather than “big bang”
- **SME-driven clarity**: tight loops to translate technical accuracy into learner-friendly explanations
- **Learning experience focus**: interaction, pacing, and knowledge checks to support retention
- **Stakeholder alignment**: clear definitions of “done” and review milestones for acceptance
