# Robinson R44 Raven II e-Learning  
_Product ownership case study_
## Overview

This repository presents a **product ownership case study** for the Robinson R44 Raven II e-learning course, a computer-based training (CBT) product designed for helicopter pilots undergoing initial and recurrent training.

The product delivers a structured, interactive learning experience covering aircraft systems, procedures, and operational knowledge, while meeting regulatory requirements for aviation training organizations.
## Problem Context

Traditional helicopter ground training relies heavily on instructor-led briefings and static materials, which can be time-consuming, inconsistent, and difficult to scale across training organizations.

The Robinson R44 Raven II e-learning product was created to:
- Standardize theoretical training content
- Reduce instructor workload
- Improve learner accessibility through multi-device support
- Enable scalable, compliant training delivery

- Defining product vision and scope
- Managing the product backlog and prioritization
- Translating regulatory and user needs into actionable requirements
- Collaborating with subject-matter experts, designers, and engineers
